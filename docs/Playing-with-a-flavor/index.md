# Playing with a flavor

With AeroPress you can produce numerous flavors of your coffee. The taste of the coffee depends on the coffee grind, water temperature, extraction time, agitation, and amount of coffee used. The taste of your coffee can differ in extraction - can be more bitter or more acid. Less extraction means the taste has more acidity, while more extraction means it tastes more bitter. The best way to find your favorite taste is to experiment. Below you see that the taste changes depending on the given factors. The guide does not provide the exact range for these factors as it depends on your judgement.
