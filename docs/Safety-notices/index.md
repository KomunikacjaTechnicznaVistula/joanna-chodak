Make sure the Filer Cap is strongly attached to the Chamber to prevent it from dropping out.

In Inverted AeroPress make sure the Plunger is attached to the Chamber before pouring a hot water.

In Normal AeroPress make sure a Filter Cap is attached to the Chamber before pouring a hot water.

When you flip the AeroPress hold the Chamber with one hand and the Plunger with the other hand to prevent them from splitting caused by air pressure. When the AeroPress is on the cup hold the cup with one hand and the AeroPress with another.

Never press hard. It can result in a breakage and spills.
