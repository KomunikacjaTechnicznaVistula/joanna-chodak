        <p>The metropolitan city of Kraków is known as the city of churches. The abundance of
            landmark, historic temples along with the plenitude of monasteries and convents earned
            the city a countrywide reputation as the "Northern Rome" in the past. The churches of
            Kraków comprise over 120 places of worship (2007) of which over 65 were built in the
            20th century. More are still being added.<sup><xref
